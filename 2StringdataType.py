String Data Type
String are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. Python allows for either
pairs of single or double quotes. Strings are immutable sequence data type, i.e each time one makes any changes
to a string, completely new string object is created.

a_str = 'Hello Python'
print(a_str)
print(a_str[1]) # output is e
print(a_str[3:6])
